        <!-- First Featurette -->
        <div class="featurette" id="topic1">
            <img class="featurette-image img-square img-responsive pull-right" src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/159282/technology-servers-server-159282.jpeg?w=940&h=650&dpr=2&auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb">
            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Version Control Systems
                
    
            <p class="lead">A version control system is a repository used to organize and maintain files or other groups of information. When a user makes a repository, it records the original document while also keeping track of the changes (like in status and versions). Version control systems are frequently used in businesses or corporations because a file can be backed up on a server and never overwritten. Also, if a group is working on the same project, a version control system can allow the users to work together simultaneously. This is wonderful because it allows multiple users to work at the same time rather than having only one user work.  </p>
            
            <p class="lead">This type of system is fascinating because it allows users to save their work during every stage of development. It is almost like a digital trail of breadcrumbs, allowing the user to travel back and view each version of their work. This will be important to our class because as we are developing web applications, we will need to save each version as to not lose our work. </p>

        <!-- Second Featurette -->
        <div class="featurette" id="topic2">
            <img class="featurette-image  img-responsive pull-left" src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/265110/pexels-photo-265110.jpeg?w=940&h=650&dpr=2&auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb">
            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Git
               
            <p class="lead">One of the most popular version control systems is called git. Git is free and is open source, meaning that anyone can use and modify git in any way they like. It saves multiple versions of a user’s work. Git’s processes run faster and will prevent the overwrite of a shared file. Git is a distributed revision control system, meaning that it is crafted for speed, data integrity, and non-linear workflow. </p>
            
            <p class="lead">Git is important because it is the version control system that we will be using in class. We are using GitHub as our git VCS. It will allow us to save our work while also being able to retrieve previous versions of our work.

        <div class="featurette" id="topic3">
            <img class="featurette-image img-responsive pull-right" src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/735911/pexels-photo-735911.jpeg?w=940&h=650&dpr=2&auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb">
            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Git Commands
            <p class="lead">Git offers a wide list of commands that help the developer use Git in a more useful way. To create a new project, you can use git init or if you want to use an existing project, use git clone. After that, the commands git add, git commit, and git push are used. Typically, a developer will use those commands in that order, as git add will add all the information to a cache, git commit will put the information into a local repository, and git push will transfer the information to a remote repository.</p>
            
            <p class="lead">These commands are important in that they help the developer transfer information to different repositories. For our class, we will be using the basic commands of git add, commit, and push to store our information.

       <!-- Fourth Featurette -->
        <div class="featurette" id="topic4">
            <img class="featurette-image  img-responsive pull-left" src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/373543/pexels-photo-373543.jpeg?w=940&h=650&dpr=2&auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb">
            <h2 class="featurette-heading"> Local Repository
            <p class="lead">A local repository is one that resides on a remote server and is shared among multiple team members. Typically, a user’s local repository is the area in which local changes are made, like a cloud workspace or a computer. The local area contains three areas, the working directory (or sandbox), the staging area, and the local repo. This is where the Git commands Git add and Git commit are used. Git is wonderful in that it can make a local directory that isn’t under version control and turn it into a Git repository or it can clone a Git repository from somewhere else </p>
            
            <p class="lead">Local repositories allow a user to save data before it is pushed into a remote Git repository. Also, a user can organize files before they send them off. It is important for our class because they are the means by which we will create our applications. For our class, Cloud 9 is our local repository.</p>

        <!-- Fifth Featurette -->
        <div class="featurette" id="topic5">
            <img class="featurette-image  img-responsive pull-right" src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/236093/pexels-photo-236093.jpeg?w=940&h=650&dpr=2&auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb">
            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Remote Repository
            <p class="lead">A remote repository is a repository that resides on a remote server that is shared among multiple users. A user can use a remote repository to publish their code to other users and the general public. Git allows its remote repository to be central, meaning that even hundreds of developers can still share the same resources. Developers can push information to the remote repository or they can pull information from it. </p>
            
            <p class="lead">Remote repositories are important for those who want to document their development processes to other developers and to the public. I find this fascinating because you can link almost any local repository to a single remote repository. We will be using this often as a way to publish our web applications to GitHub, which is out remote repository.</p>
